I'm a Data Science student at the University of California San Diego 🔱, passionate about leveraging machine learning and quantitative analysis to solve complex problems. From developing deep reinforcement learning agents for financial trading to analyzing climate data at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, I thrive at the intersection of data-driven research and real-world impact.

🚀 **What I'm Focused On**

🔬 **Research**: As a Data Science Researcher at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, I'm currently preprocessing large-scale climate datasets and developing custom evaluation metrics to benchmark the physical plausibility of machine learning models.

📈 **Quantitative Finance**: I recently finished an internship where I built an LSTM-based stock prediction model and a Deep Reinforcement Learning agent that boosted options trading returns by 12% for a $1.3M student-run fund.

🌱 **Learning**: I'm continuously diving deeper into Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, and advanced ML techniques to tackle challenges with unstructured data.

🏆 **Featured Projects**

<details>
  <summary>🥇 <strong>Hackathon Winner | Geospatial ML & CV for Homeless Services</strong></summary>
  <br>
  I led the development of an ML forecasting system that won a hackathon against 100+ professionals. Our solution used 35+ geospatial, transit, and demographic features to strategically identify optimal locations for homeless service centers in San Diego with 67% accuracy. We also deployed a real-time computer vision system using Oxen.ai and EyePop.ai to provide live monitoring and precise demand insights.

<details>
  <summary>🔭 <strong>Astrophysics | Simulating Black Hole Evolution</strong></summary>
  <br>
  In a 20-week, PhD-supervised research project, I simulated the growth trajectories of over 100 black hole seed scenarios. By analyzing 20 million years of data with Eddington accretion models, my visualizations demonstrated that a seed's initial mass can impact its growth rate by up to 40%.

<details>
  <summary>💡 <strong>Predictive Modeling | Building Energy Load Forecasting</strong></summary>
  <br>
  I engineered a multiple linear regression model that achieved 91% accuracy in predicting building heating and cooling loads. By applying k-means clustering, I identified distinct energy consumption patterns, leading to strategies that improved energy efficiency and reduced operational costs by 15%.
